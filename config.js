            description: 'The gods are outraged, locked in conflict amongst themselves, and their celestial battles spill onto the Earth. The Trojan War not only cleaved mortals apart but also fractured the unity of the divine pantheon. Wielding their mighty powers, they reshape the very fabric of the world we know. Poseidon, with aspirations of extending his dominion, commands the waters to rise, asserting his influence over the seas. Zeus, in response, conjures more potent storms, countering the efforts of Demeter, who nurtures the land. Hera, too, employs her divine authority to disrupt birthrates and marriages among the supporters of rival deities. Athena seizes upon the chaos to foment conflict and spread the flames of war. Meanwhile, Hades sits upon his infernal throne, the gates of the underworld yawning wide to receive the flood of refugees fleeing the turmoil of the surface world. In this unprecedented exodus, the lower realms offer an escape, a refuge from the trials of the upper world. The balance of power has shifted, and the realm below emerges as a sanctuary, casting its somber allure over those seeking solace.',

He bides his time, waiting for the cloak of night to fall before dispatching his men to execute a stealthy maneuver: disguised as civilians, his soldiers were ordered to pass by the enemy camps and drop jars of olive oils in front. The soldiers of the right flank have long been deprived of the taste of the rich and intense olive oil. This precious substance has become a rarity in the wake of the gods\'\ tumultuous conflict; its production plummeted, rendering it scarce. The soldiers started fighting in the name of the lucky one that would have a taste of it, and what started as a soldier fight grew to a full battle, destroying the entire command of the right wing. Having successfully purloined two ships and enough wood to craft some others, Odysseus and his steadfast crew set sail for Ithaca. Their journey unfolds aboard a vessel crafted from timber that never had the chance to reach its full glory, hewn prematurely from trees denied the opportunity to unveil their complete strength." ,

            description: 'Arriving in Ithaca, Ulysses paused for a brief moment, contemplating whether this was yet another challenge orchestrated by the gods. The island appeared unrecognizable at first glance. His once verdant and thriving kingdom, adorned with trees cascading from the mountain peaks to the sea, had undergone a transformation. The landscape had altered drastically; landslides had ravaged the terraces, and a predominant pale yellow hue now dominated the scenery.Upon disembarking, he encountered an almost deserted port, devoid of the lively bustle he remembered, with no fountain in the main square to quench his thirst. Overwhelmed by the despair of his situation, Ulysses found himself running aimlessly in every direction until he reached a cliff – the very cliff of Hades. Legend held that those who leapt from this precipice would plunge directly into the realm of the underworld, such was the depth of the waters below.',

But just as he prepared to surrender to the abyss, a familiar silhouette emerged, approaching him – his old philosophical mentor. Their eyes met, and in that moment, Ulysses recalled the wisdom of an ancient saying: "As long as there is life, there is hope; as long as there is hope, there is opportunity for transformation." Thus, he hesitated, torn between the urge to succumb to despair and the flicker of hope ignited by his reunion with his mentor.',
